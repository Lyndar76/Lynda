Analyzing the economic impact of market changes on different regions.
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
Data exploration steps like calculating descriptive statistics, checking for missing values and duplicates, and visualizing data using pair plots, heatmaps, and histograms. This is essential for understanding data distribution and relationships between variables.
For modeling in machine learning, 
Used Linear Regression Model. The evaluation metrics (MSE and R-squared) you obtained provide an initial baseline for model performance.
GridSearchCV to tune the hyperparameter 'alpha' for a Ridge regression model. 
For Deep Learning, Linear Regression Model:
Linear regression using TensorFlow and Keras. This model consists of Dense layers with ReLU activations, dropout for regularization, and an Adam optimizer.
The model was trained for a maximum of 100 epochs, using early stopping to prevent overfitting.
The evaluation metric used was Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test set.
The plot of training and validation loss shows the learning process and potentially indicates areas for model adjustments.
